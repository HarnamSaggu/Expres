		General Info ====
			semicolons will be used for the end of "lines"

		====

		Variables ====
			mutable variables
			data type can be inferred
			"
			> variableName, value

			> dataType: variableName
			"

			# PASS BY REFERENCE
			# WEAKLY TYPED

		Arrays ====
			mutable arrays
			data type is inferred
			"
			> arrayName[]

			> dataType: arrayName[]

			> arrayName[index], value
			"

			# PASS BY REFERENCE
			# WEAKLY TYPED

			and (like) kotlin intervals
			"
			> oneToTen, 1...10
			> oneUpToTen, 1../10
			"

		====

		Snippet ====
			i will use snippets of code, complied code which can be stored under the data type snippet
			"
			> snippet: snippetName, {code}
			"

		====

		If ====
			just plain old ifs
			"
			if(boolean, {body}, ...)
			"

		====

		For ====
			both for like in java and kotlin
			"
			for(array, counterName, {body})

			for(counterName, condition, variableChange, {body})
			"

		While ====
			normal while
			"
			while(condition, {body})
			"

		====

		[Function ====
			"
			> functionName(dataType: parameterName, ...), {code}
			"

			the rest is TODO, custom functions will be dealt with last

		Commands ====
			The parser will take a sentence (a list of tokens typically between semicolons) and then match it
			with a command.

			Command types ====
				0.[0]. VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT WITH VALUE
				        - name
				        - value (commands)
				0.[1]. ARRAY ASSIGNMENT WITH SIZE
				        - name
				        - size (commands)
				0.[3]. ARRAY ASSIGNMENT
				        - name
				0.[3]. ARRAY ELEMENT ASSIGNMENT
				        - name
				        - value (commands)

				1.[4]. FUNCTION CALL
				        - name
				        - arguments (commands)

				(commands which are inherently returns of a value)
				2.[5]. VARIABLE GETTER
				        - name
				2.[6]. ARRAY ELEMENT GETTER
				        - name
				        - index

				3.[7]. OPERATION
				        - first operand (commands)
				        - operator (name)
				        - second operand (commands) (except for NOT)

		    Command data structure ====
		        They all have names
		        Then we can split 0-3 into assigment subtype
		        Function call is unique
		        Getters can be one subtype
		        Operation is also unique

		Bracket number ====
			Within a function call, the argument tokens are assigned a bracket number which corresponds
			with the number of open brackets preceding them
